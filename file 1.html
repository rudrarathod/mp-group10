            <br>
            <p>Rakesh Sharma was commissioned into the Indian Air Force as a pilot in 1970. He flew 21 combat missions
                in a MiG-21 fighter jet during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.
                On 20 September 1982, he was chosen to become a cosmonaut as part of a joint initiative between India
                and the Soviet Union. He underwent rigorous training for two years at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut
                Training Center in Moscow and was even locked inside a closed room at an IAF facility in Bangalore for
                72 hours to detect if he suffered from claustrophobia. Wing Commander Ravish Malhotra was on standby.

            <p>Rakesh Sharma entered space aboard the Soviet rocket Soyuz T-11, thereby becoming the first Indian to go
                to space. The Soyuz T-11 rocket was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist
                Republic on 3 April 1984. It docked and transferred the three-member Soviet-Indian international crew
                which included the spaceship commander Yury Malyshev and flight engineer Gennadi Strekalov, to the
                Salyut 7 Orbital Station.</p>
            He spent 7 days, 21 hours and 40 minutes aboard the Salyut 7 space station. The mission conducted scientific
            and technical studies, including 43 experimental sessions, but he was tasked with bio-medicine and
            remote-sensing.
            Over the years, Rakesh Sharma rose up the ranks and retired as a Wing Commander. In 1987, he joined the
            Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as the chief test pilot at Nashik and moved to the Bangalore division in
            1992. He retired from flying in 2001.
            The Soviet-Indian crew had a joint television news conference with Moscow officials and then Indian Prime
            Minister Indira Gandhi. When asked, how India looked from outer space, Sharma replied, Sare Jahan Se Achcha.

            <p>Upon his return from the space, Sharma was conferred the honour of the Hero of the Soviet Union. He is
                the only Indian to have been conferred this honour. Indiaâ€™s highest peacetime gallantry award, the
                Ashoka Chakra, was also conferred on him, and the other two members of the mission, Malyshev and
                Strekalov.</p>
