    <br>Raja Harishchandra (transl. King Harishchandra) is a 1913 Indian silent film directed and produced by Dadasaheb
    Phalke. It is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film. Raja Harishchandra features Dattatraya
    Damodar Dabke, Anna Salunke, Bhalchandra Phalke, and Gajanan Vasudev Sane and is based on the legend of
    Harishchandra, with Dabke portraying the title character. The film, being silent, had English, Marathi, and
    Hindi-language intertitles.

    Phalke decided to make a feature film after watching The Life of Christ (1906) at a theatre in Bombay in April 1911.
    In February 1912, he went to London for two weeks to learn filmmaking techniques and upon return founded Phalke
    Films Company. He imported the hardware required for filmmaking and exhibition from England, France, Germany, and
    the United States. Phalke shot a short film Ankurachi Wadh (Growth of a Pea Plant) to attract investors for his
    venture. He published advertisements in various newspapers calling for the cast and crew. As no women were available
    to play female roles, male actors performed the female roles. Phalke was in charge of scriptment, direction,
    production design, make-up, film editing, along with film processing. Trymbak B. Telang handled the camera. Phalke
    completed filming in six months and 27 days producing a film of 3,700 feet (1,100 m), about four reels.

    The film premiered at the Olympia Theatre, Bombay, on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on 3 May 1913 at
    the Coronation Cinematograph and Variety Hall, Girgaon. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the
    film industry in the country. The film is partially lost; only the first and last reels of the film are preserved at
    the National Film Archive of India. Some film historians believe these belong to a 1917 remake of the film by Phalke
    titled Satyavadi Raja Harishchandra.

    The status of Raja Harishchandra as the first full-length Indian feature film has been debated. Some film historians
    consider Dadasaheb Torne's silent film Shree Pundalik, released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film. The
    Government of India, however, recognises Raja Harishchandra as the first Indian feature film.</br>

    <br>King Harishchandra (D. D. Dabke) is shown teaching his son, Rohitashva (Bhalchandra Phalke), how to shoot with a
    bow and arrow in the presence of Queen Taramati (Anna Salunke). His citizens ask him to go on a hunting expedition.
    While on the hunt, Harishchandra hears the cries of some women. He reaches a place where the sage Vishvamitra
    (Gajanan Sane) is performing a yajna to get help from Triguna Shakti (three powers) against their will.[a]
    Harishchandra unwittingly interrupts Vishvamitra in the midst of his yajna by releasing the three powers. To appease
    Vishvamitra's wrath, Harishchandra offers his kingdom. Returning to the royal palace, he informs Taramati of the
    happenings. Vishvamitra sends Harishchandra, Taramati, and Rohitashva in exile and asks them to arrange for
    dakshina. While in exile, Rohitashva dies and Harishchandra sends Taramati to ask the Dom king for arranging a free
    cremation. While Taramati is on her way to meet the Dom king, Vishvamitra frames her for the murder of the prince of
    Kashi. Taramati faces trial, pleads guilty and is ordered to be beheaded by Harishchandra. When he raises his sword
    to complete his task, a pleased Lord Shiva appears. Vishvamitra reveals that he was examining Harishchandra's
    integrity, returns the crown to him and brings Rohitashva back to life.[3][4]</br>

        <br>On 14 April 1911, Dadasaheb Phalke with his elder son Bhalchandra went to see a film, Amazing Animals, at
        the America India Picture Palace,[7] Girgaon.[8] Surprised at seeing animals on the screen, Bhalchandra informed
        his mother, Saraswatibai, about his experience. None of the family members believed them, so Phalke took his
        family to see the film the next day. As it was Easter, the theatre screened a film about Jesus, The Life of
        Christ (1906) by the French director Alice Guy-Blaché.[6][8][b] While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke
        envisioned Hindu deities Rama and Krishna instead and decided to start in the business of "moving pictures".[8]
        After completing his two-week trip to London to learn filmmaking techniques, he founded Phalke Films Company on
        1 April 1912.[9][10]

        During his London trip, Phalke had placed an order for a Williamson camera and Kodak raw films and a perforator
        which reached Bombay (now Mumbai) in May 1912.[11][12] He set up a processing room and taught his family to
        perforate and develop the film.[11] Though Phalke was certain of his idea of filmmaking, he could not find any
        investors. So, he decided to make a short film to demonstrate the techniques. He planted some peas in a pot,
        placed a camera in front of it, and shot one frame a day for over a month. This resulted in a film, lasting just
        over a minute, of the seed growing, sprouting, and changing into a climber. Phalke titled this short film
        Ankurachi Wadh (Growth of a Pea Plant) and showed it to selected individuals. Some of them, including
        Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Narayanrao Devhare, offered Phalke a loan.[12][13]</br>

            <h3 align="center">Story

        <p align=center><img src="1st movie.jpg" /></p>
        <br>In his Marathi language magazine Suvarnamala, Phalke had published a story Surabaichi Kahani (A Tale of
        Sura). The story, which depicted the ill effects of alcoholism, was the first he considered for filming. After
        watching several American films screened in Bombay, he observed that they included mystery and romance, which
        the audiences liked. His family members suggested that the storyline should appeal to middle-class people and
        women and it should also highlight Indian culture.[14]

        After considering various stories depicted in Hindu mythology, Phalke's family shortlisted the legends of
        Krishna, Savitri and Satyavan, and Harishchandra.[11] At the time, a play based on the legends of Harishchandra
        was popular on Marathi and Urdu stages.[15] Friends and neighbours had often called Phalke "Harishchandra" for
        having sold all his belongings, except his wife's mangala sutra, to fulfil his filmmaking dream.[13] Thus,
        Phalke decided on the legends of Harishchandra and wrote the script for his feature film.[15]</br>

        </b></br></h3>
        <p align=center><img src="Phalke.jpg" /></p>

        <br>Phalke published advertisements in various newspapers like Induprakash calling for the cast and crew
        required for the film. It was well-received and huge number of applicants came in for the auditions.[c] Despite
        a growing response to the advertisement, he was not satisfied with the performers' skills. He discontinued the
        advertisements and decided to scout for the artists through theatre companies.[16]

        Padurang Gadhadhar Sane and Gajanan Vasudev Sane were among the first artists to join Phalke Films Company.[17]
        The former was playing female roles in the Natyakala theatre company; the latter was performing in Urdu
        plays.[16] Both joined for a salary of ₹40 per month. Gajanan Sane introduced his acquaintance Dattatraya
        Damodar Dabke. Phalke was impressed with his physique and personality and offered him the lead role of
        Harishchandra.[17]

        In response to the advertisement, four prostitutes auditioned for the role of Taramati. Phalke rejected them for
        not having satisfactory looks and revised the advertisement to read: "Only good-looking women should come for
        interview."[17] Two more prostitutes auditioned but left after two days. A young lady, who was a mistress,
        auditioned and Phalke selected her for the female lead. She rehearsed for four days. However, on the fifth day,
        her master objected to her working in the film and took her away.[17] In despair, Phalke also visited Bombay's
        red-light area on Grant Road in Kamathipura. He was asked either to pay a high salary or to marry the woman.[18]
        One day, while having tea at a restaurant on Grant Road,[18] Phalke noticed Krishna Hari alias Anna Salunke, an
        effeminate young man with slender features and hands.[19] Salunke was working as a cook or waiter at the
        restaurant on a monthly salary of ₹10.[19][20] He agreed to work in films when Phalke offered him a raise of
        five rupees.[21][d]

        Phalke auditioned many boys for the role of Rohitashva, son of Harishchandra and Taramati, but none of the
        parents would allow their children to work in the film as the character would have to live in the forests and
        was to die. Finally, Phalke's elder son Bhalchandra was assigned the role, becoming the first child actor in
        Indian cinema.[17][23]</br>
