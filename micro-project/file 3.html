    <p>The Padma Awards are one of the highest civilian honours of India announced annually on the eve of Republic Day.
        The Awards are given in three categories: Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), Padma
        Bhushan (distinguished service of higher order) and Padma Shri (distinguished service). The award seeks to
        recognize achievements in all fields of activities or disciplines where an element of public service is
        involved.
        The Padma Awards are conferred on the recommendations made by the Padma Awards Committee, which is constituted
        by the Prime Minister every year. The nomination process is open to the public. Even self-nomination can be
        made.</p>

        service/performance of the highest order in any field of human endeavour. It is treated on a different footing
