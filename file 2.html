    <p>Cornelia Sorabji (15 November 1866 – 6 July 1954) was an Indian lawyer, social reformer and writer. She was the
        first female graduate from Bombay University, and the first woman to study law at Oxford University. Returning
        to India after her studies at Oxford, Sorabji became involved in social and advisory work on behalf of the
        purdahnashins, women who were forbidden to communicate with the outside male world, but she was unable to defend
        them in court since, as a woman, she did not hold professional standing in the Indian legal system. Hoping to
        remedy this, Sorabji presented herself for the LLB examination of Bombay University in 1897 and the pleader's
        examination of Allahabad High Court in 1899. She became the first female advocate in India but would not be
        recognised as a barrister until the law which barred women from practising was changed in 1923.
        15:07 22-05-2022She was involved with several social service campaigning groups, including the National Council
        for Women in India, the Federation of University Women, and the Bengal League of Social Service for Women. She
        opposed the imposition of Western perspectives on the movement for women's change in India, and took a cautious
        approach to social reform, opposing rapid change. Sorabji believed that until all women were educated, political
        reform would not be of genuine lasting value. She supported the British Raj, and purdah for upper-caste Hindu
        women, and opposed Indian self-rule. Her views prevented her obtaining the support needed to undertake later
        social reforms. Sorabji authored multiple publications, which were influential in the early 20th century.</p>

    <p>Letter by Mary Hobhouse, published in The Times, 13 April 1888, Sorabji
        Cornelia Sorabji was born on 15 November 1866 in Nashik, in the Bombay Presidency, British India. She was one of
        ten children, and was named in honour of Lady Cornelia Maria Darling Ford, her adoptive grandmother. Her father,
        the Reverend Sorabji Karsedji, was a Christian missionary who had converted from Zoroastrianism, and Sorabji
        believed that she had been a key figure in convincing Bombay University to admit women to its degree
        programmes.[2] Her mother, Francina Ford (née Santya), had been adopted at the age of twelve and brought up by a
        British couple, and helped to establish several girls' schools in Poona (now Pune).[3][4] Her mother's support
        for girls' education, and care for the local needy, was an inspiration for Cornelia Sorabji to advocate for
        women.[5][6] In her books, Cornelia Sorabji barely touched on religion (other than describing Parsi rituals),
        and did not write about any pressures relating to religious conversion in her autobiographical works.[6]
        Sorabji had five surviving sisters including educator and missionary Susie Sorabji and medical doctor Alice
        Pennell, and one surviving brother; two other brothers died in infancy.[7] She spent her childhood initially in
        Belgaum and later in Pune. She received her education both at home and at mission schools. She enrolled in
        Deccan College, as its first woman student, and received the top marks in her cohort for the final degree
        examination, which would have entitled her to a government scholarship to study further in England.[1][5]
        According to Sorabji, she was denied the scholarship, and instead took up a temporary position as a professor of
        English at Gujarat College, an educational institution for men.[5][8]
        She became the first female graduate of Bombay University, with a first-class degree in literature. Sorabji
        wrote in 1888 to the National Indian Association for assistance in completing her education. This was championed
        by Mary Hobhouse (whose husband Arthur was a member of the Council of India) and Adelaide Manning, who
        contributed funds, as did Florence Nightingale, Sir William Wedderburn and others. Sorabji arrived in England in
        1889 and stayed with Manning and Hobhouse.[9] In 1892, she was given special permission by Congregational
        Decree, due in large part to the petitions of her English friends, to take the post-graduate Bachelor of Civil
        Law exam at Somerville College, Oxford, becoming the first woman to ever do so.[10][11] Sorabji was the first
        woman to be admitted as a reader to the Codrington Library of All Souls College, Oxford, at <a href="">William
            Anson</a> Sir William Anson's invitation in 1890.[12]</p>

        Upon returning to India in 1894, Sorabji became involved in social and advisory work on behalf of the
        purdahnashins, women who were forbidden to communicate with the outside male world. In many cases, these women
        owned considerable property, yet had no access to the necessary legal expertise to defend it. Sorabji was given
        special permission to enter pleas on their behalf before British agents of Kathiawar and Indore principalities,
        but she was unable to defend them in court since, as a woman, she did not hold professional standing in the
        Indian legal system. Hoping to remedy this situation, Sorabji presented herself for the LLB examination of
        Bombay University in 1897 and the pleader's examination of Allahabad High Court in 1899. She was the first
        female advocate in India, but would not be recognised as a barrister until the law which barred women from
        practising was changed in 1923.
        Sorabji began petitioning the India Office as early as 1902 to provide for a female legal advisor to represent
        women and minors in provincial courts. In 1904, she was appointed Lady Assistant to the Court of Wards of Bengal
        and by 1907, due to the need for such representation, Sorabji was working in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar,
        Orissa, and Assam. In the next 20 years of service, it is estimated that Sorabji helped over 600 women and
        orphans fight legal battles, sometimes at no charge. She would later write about many of these cases in her work
        Between the Twilights and her two autobiographies. In 1924, the legal profession was opened to women in India,
        and Sorabji began practising in Calcutta. However, due to male bias and discrimination, she was confined to
        preparing opinions on cases, rather than pleading them before the court.[1]
        Sorabji retired from the high court in 1929, and settled in London, visiting India during the winters. She died
        at her home, Northumberland House on Green Lanes in Manor House, London, on 6 July 1954, aged 87.

        Social and reform work Sorabji's primary interest in her campaigning work was in social service.[15] She took a
        circumspect approach to social reform, supporting the British Raj, purdah for upper-caste Hindu women, and
        opposing rapid reform,[15] believing that until all women were educated, political reform would not provide "any
        real and lasting value".[16] She also opposed the imposition of Western women's perspectives on the movement for
        women's change in India.[17]
        She was associated with the Bengal branch of the National Council for Women in India, the Federation of
        University Women, and the Bengal League of Social Service for Women.[1] For her services to the Indian nation,
        she was awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal in 1909.[1] Although an Anglophile, Sorabji had no desire to see
        "the wholesale imposition of a British legal system on Indian society any more than she sought the
        transplantation of other Western values."[18] Early in her career, Sorabji had supported the campaign for Indian
        independence, relating women's rights to the capacity for self-government. Although she supported traditional
        Indian life and culture, Sorabji promoted reform of Hindu laws regarding child marriage and Sati by widows.[4]
        She believed that the true impetus behind social change was education and that until the majority of illiterate
        women had access to it, the suffrage movement would be a failure.
        By the late 1920s, however, Sorabji had adopted a staunch anti-nationalist attitude. By 1927, she was actively
        involved in promoting support for the Empire and preserving the rule of the British Raj. She favourably viewed
        the polemical attack on Indian self-rule in Katherine Mayo's book Mother India (1927),[1] and condemned Mahatma
        Gandhi's campaign of civil disobedience.[13] She toured to propagate her political views; her publicised beliefs
        would end up costing her the support needed to undertake later social reforms. One such failed project was the
        League for Infant Welfare, Maternity, and District Nursing.
        Pallavi Rastogi, reviewing the autobiography India Calling, wrote the Sorabji's life was "fraught with
        contradictions", as were those of others who were unable to reconcile Western and Indian ways of life.[21]
        Historian Geraldine Forbes argued that Sorabji's opposition to nationalism and feminism has "caused historians
        to neglect the role she played in giving credibility to the British critique of those educated women who were
        now part of the political landscape."For Leslie Flemming, Sorabji's autobiographical works are "a means of
        justifying her unusual life by constructing herself as a change-agent" and, although they are not widely read in
        modern terms, succeeded on those terms by having an influential readership in the early 20th century.[22]</p>
